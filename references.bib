@article{karaoz-kasif-whole-genome-annotation-pnas-2004,
    abstract = {{The advent of high-throughput biology has catalyzed a remarkable improvement in our ability to identify new genes. A large fraction of newly discovered genes have an unknown functional role, particularly when they are specific to a particular lineage or organism. These genes, currently labeled "hypothetical," might support important biological cell functions and could potentially serve as targets for medical, diagnostic, or pharmacogenomic studies. An important challenge to the scientific community is to associate these newly predicted genes with a biological function that can be validated by experimental screens. In the absence of sequence or structural homology to known genes, we must rely on advanced biotechnological methods, such as DNA chips and protein-protein interaction screens as well as computational techniques to assign putative functions to these genes. In this article, we propose an effective methodology for combining biological evidence obtained in several high-throughput experimental screens and integrating this evidence in a way that provides consistent functional assignments to hypothetical genes. We use the visualization method of propagation diagrams to illustrate the flow of functional evidence that supports the functional assignments produced by the algorithm. Our results contain a number of predictions and furnish strong evidence that integration of functional information is indeed a promising direction for improving the accuracy and robustness of functional genomics.}},

    abstract = {{HIV} Dependency Factors ({HDFs}) are a class of human proteins that are essential for {HIV} replication, but are not lethal to the host cell when silenced. Three previous genome-wide {RNAi} experiments identified {HDF} sets with little overlap. We combine data from these three studies with a human protein interaction network to predict new {HDFs}, using an intuitive algorithm called {SinkSource} and four other algorithms published in the literature. Our algorithm achieves high precision and recall upon cross validation, as do the other methods. A number of {HDFs} that we predict are known to interact with {HIV} proteins. They belong to multiple protein complexes and biological processes that are known to be manipulated by {HIV}. We also demonstrate that many predicted {HDF} genes show significantly different programs of expression in early response to {SIV} infection in two non-human primate species that differ in {AIDS} progression. Our results suggest that many {HDFs} are yet to be discovered and that they have potential value as prognostic markers to determine pathological outcome and the likelihood of {AIDS} development. More generally, if multiple genome-wide gene-level studies have been performed at independent labs to study the same biological system or phenomenon, our methodology is applicable to interpret these studies simultaneously in the context of molecular interaction networks and to ask if they reinforce or contradict each other. Medicines to cure infectious diseases usually target proteins in the pathogens. Since pathogens have short life cycles, the targeted proteins can rapidly evolve and make the medicines ineffective, especially in viruses such as {HIV}. However, since viruses have very small genomes, they must exploit the cellular machinery of the host to propagate. Therefore, disrupting the activity of selected host proteins may impede viruses. Three recent experiments have discovered hundreds of such proteins in human cells that {HIV} depends upon. Surprisingly, these three sets have very little overlap. In this work, we demonstrate that this discrepancy can be explained by considering physical interactions between the human proteins in these studies. Moreover, we exploit these interactions to predict new dependency factors for {HIV}. Our predictions show very significant overlaps with human proteins that are known to interact with {HIV} proteins and with human cellular processes that are known to be subverted by the virus. Most importantly, we show that proteins predicted by us may play a prominent role in affecting {HIV}-related disease progression in lymph nodes. Therefore, our predictions constitute a powerful resource for experimentalists who desire to discover new human proteins that can control the spread of {HIV}.},

                   genome scale analysis of molecular interaction networks
                   has made possible new approaches to inferring protein
                   function. This paper describes a method of assigning
                   functions based on a probabilistic analysis of graph
                   neighborhoods in a protein-protein interaction network.
                   The method exploits the fact that graph neighbors are
                   more likely to share functions than nodes which are not
                   neighbors. A binomial model of local neighbor function
                   labeling probability is combined with a Markov random
                   field propagation algorithm to assign function
                   probabilities for proteins in the network. RESULTS: We
                   applied the method to a protein-protein interaction
                   dataset for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using
                   the Gene Ontology (GO) terms as function labels. The
                   method reconstructed known GO term assignments with
                   high precision, and produced putative GO assignments to
                   320 proteins that currently lack GO annotation, which
                   represents about 10\% of the unlabeled proteins in S.

  abstract       = {Determining protein function is one of the most
                   challenging problems of the post-genomic era. The
                   availability of entire genome sequences and of
                   high-throughput capabilities to determine gene
                   coexpression patterns has shifted the research focus
                   from the study of single proteins or small complexes to
                   that of the entire proteome. In this context, the
                   search for reliable methods for assigning protein
                   function is of primary importance. There are various
                   approaches available for deducing the function of
                   proteins of unknown function using information derived
                   from sequence similarity or clustering patterns of
                   co-regulated genes, phylogenetic profiles,
                   protein-protein interactions (refs. 5-8 and Samanta,
                   M.P. and Liang, S., unpublished data), and protein
                   complexes. Here we propose the assignment of proteins
                   to functional classes on the basis of their network of
                   physical interactions as determined by minimizing the
                   number of protein interactions among different
                   functional categories. Function assignment is
                   proteome-wide and is determined by the global
                   connectivity pattern of the protein network. The
                   approach results in multiple functional assignments, a
                   consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent
                   solutions. We apply the method to analyze the yeast
                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein-protein interaction
                   network. The robustness of the approach is tested in a
                   system containing a high percentage of unclassified
                   proteins and also in cases of deletion and insertion of
                   specific protein interactions.},
